/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model combined with
 * user ownership. The default security posture is highly restrictive. Most data
 * collections, such as candidate profiles and job roles, are accessible only by
 * users with an 'Admin' role. This ensures that sensitive hiring data is protected
 * by default. A user's own profile document is an exception, where a strict
 * user-ownership model is applied.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into a series of flat, top-level collections (e.g.,
 * /candidateProfiles, /jobs, /users). This structure avoids complex nested
 * security rules and improves query performance. Relationships between entities,
 * such as a candidate and their interviews, are managed via ID fields within
 * documents rather than through subcollections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * 1. Admin-Only Writes by Default: Due to the sensitive nature of hiring data,
 *    write operations on most collections are restricted to 'Admin' users.
 * 2. Authenticated Reads: All authenticated users can read from collections like
 *    /jobs, allowing the application to function for non-admin users.
 * 3. User Profile Ownership: The /users/{userId} collection is strictly locked
 *    down. Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own document.
 * 4. User Enumeration Disabled: Listing the /users collection is explicitly
 *    disallowed to prevent malicious actors from discovering the list of all
 *    system users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Authorization checks rely on the `role` field denormalized onto each user's
 * document in the `/users/{userId}` collection. This requires a `get()` call
 * in helper functions (e.g., `isAdmin()`) to look up the user's role, which is
 * an efficient way to manage global permissions.
